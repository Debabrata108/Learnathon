# 🚗 AI-Powered Fraud Detection in Auto Insurance

This project presents a Machine Learning-based approach for detecting fraudulent auto insurance claims using predictive modeling techniques. It was developed as part of the Learnathon 4.0 at GIET University.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Auto insurance fraud is a growing concern. Manual fraud detection is:
- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Costly

The need is for an **intelligent, real-time fraud detection system** that automates claim assessments and minimizes investigation efforts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent auto insurance claims using ML
- Automate the claims processing pipeline
- Minimize false positives and investigation cost
- Improve efficiency and trust in the claim system

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

An **AI-Powered Fraud Detection System** built with:
- Supervised learning models for classification
- Anomaly detection for unknown patterns
- Real-time risk scoring & alert generation
- Integration into claims workflow for automation

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
4. **Fraud Prediction & Risk Scoring**
5. **Visualization & Insights**

---

## 📊 Dataset

The model uses synthetic/realistic insurance claim datasets, including:
- Customer profiles
- Historical claim records
- Vehicle inspection data
- Incident metadata (location, date, weather)

*(Replace with dataset source if public: Kaggle or custom)*
